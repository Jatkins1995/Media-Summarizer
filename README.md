# Media-Summarizer

My first project yay :D

This runs on python 2.7 and requires the pyteaser library found here https://github.com/xiaoxu193/PyTeaser

Not really much more to add.

There are a few bugs with the summarizing by PyTeaser so once I am at about 5 or 6 
supported papers I will begin contributing to it so stay tuned to both for updates!
